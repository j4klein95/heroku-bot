My first heroku deployed twitter app. This to show off the following basic skills:

* Using Tweepy, json, and requests modules (along with config which was removed from the deployed code using the "#").
* Making API calls to twitter and OpenWeatherMap.
* Creating a function in python.
* Hiding API keys in .env within a .gitignore and using Heroku's config var feature. 
* Deploying the bot to heroku.
